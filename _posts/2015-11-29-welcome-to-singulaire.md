Dear reader, I take it that after all those posts I shared over my social media accounts, you finally decided to take it to the next level and follow me on the Singulaire adventure. Thank you so much for this!

I have spent endless hours reading, deciphering, compiling and, sometimes, reposting informations about the evolution of technologies in the last years, and the upcoming evolutions that will shape both information fields and medecine.  

I don't see sharing informations as a generic purpose in my life, but I have to tell someone how I feel about the future, and the paths we follow to get there. May your friendly ears offer me the possibility to share those and have some healthy discussions. We are not specialists on most of those topics. But as end users, we'll have to understand them, at least scratch the surface of immensely complex innovations.  I do my best to understand the basics, but please feel free to enlighten me when you see a mistake or think additional information is welcome. We are all working together for a better tomorrow!
