Dear reader, I take it that after all those posts I shared over my social media accounts, you finally decided to take it to the next level and follow me on the Singulaire adventure. Thank you so much for this!

I have spent endless hours reading, deciphering, compiling and, sometimes, reposting informations about the evolution of technologies in the last years, and the upcoming evolutions that will shape both information fields and medecine. 

I do my best to understand the basics, but please feel free to enlighten me when you see a mistake or think additional information is welcome. We are all working together for a better tomorrow!
